# Rust-Tauri Sandbox.

Welcome to **Rust-Tauri Sandbox**! This repository is an experimental space dedicated to exploring and prototyping with Rust and Tauri. It contains examples, code snippets, and mini-projects that demonstrate key Rust programming language features and Tauri desktop application development.

## Purpose

The **Rust-Tauri Sandbox** is designed to:
- Provide a playground for testing Rust syntax, functionality, and Tauri integration
- Explore advanced Rust features such as ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and concurrency
- Experiment with [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) for building secure and lightweight desktop applications
- Integrate libraries and frameworks from [crates.io](https://crates.io/) and [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/) to expand app functionality
